Hi! I am Arden Chen, a young engineer interested in energy research, clean technologies, and climate science. I think this is both an important and interesting problem to solve, and I've always wanted to contribute to our efforts towards a solution.

As a battery researcher, I've worked primarily with sodium-ion batteries, trying to improve their competitiveness as an alternative to traditional lithium-ion batteries. My projects include material synthesis of NaV<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and Na<sub>4</sub>Fe<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, aqueous slurry processing for thick electrodes, and anode-free sodium metal batteries.

I also have experience as a software engineer and data analyst. I've been programming since middle school, learning with small projects and small apps. I've attended many hackathons and programming competitions, and was heavily involved in my high school's FTC robotics team. Academically, I use MATLAB and Python extensively for research data analysis. I also have experience in making web apps/sites, business operations apps, and budgeting systems through working for a software consulting company.

On the side, I enjoy reading, bouldering, video games, and doing crosswords.
